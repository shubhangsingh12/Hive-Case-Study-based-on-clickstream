The implementation phase can be divided into the following parts:

>>Copying the data set into the HDFS:
                                     1. Launch an EMR cluster that utilizes the Hive services, and
                                     2. Move the data from the S3 bucket into the HDFS 

>>Creating the database and launching Hive queries on your EMR cluster:
                                                                       1. Create the structure of your database, 
  								       2. Use optimized techniques to run your queries as efficiently as possible
                                                                       3. Show the improvement of the performance after using optimization on any single query.
                                                                       4. Run Hive queries to answer the questions given below.

>>Cleaning up
             1. Drop your database, and
             2. Terminate your cluster
